Respnosive Navigation Bar :
                        
                          This is the code for the responsive navigation bar that opens and slides left when the width of the webpage is changed. 
                          It automatically appears when the width of the screen is reduced to 800px .
                          You can use it in your own projects and websites to make it more responsive. 
                          
                          The main focus is on the use of "CSS Media query" that allows to add more response to the webpage.
